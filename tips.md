## Tips and Tricks
* You can use relative number in hours instead of timestamp in "from:" field, example : "-12" to keep just last twelve hours
* F5 and Ctrl+R will do reload request
* Pressing the Enter key while in "from:" or "to:" fields will submit reload request with the new time
* Alt+click in KPIs table will enable the KPI but will not perform request: useful to select several KPIs and do single request
* Click on the chart line will highlight it and display the exact time and value
* Right mouse click in the chart area shows some potentiously useful options
* Pay attention to status bar, all requests that are expected to be long (network) put some message in the status bar
