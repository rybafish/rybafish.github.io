# Connection Manager

Rybafish has a little connection manager allowing you to configure and save several connections to several data sources.

To init the connection manager you just go File -> Connect or Alt+C

Note: connection type selection is only available for versions above 093beta0 and experimental: True in config.yaml

Connections are saved in file connections.yaml.

Passwords are stored in encripted form in the same file.
