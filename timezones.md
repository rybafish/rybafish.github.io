### Description
There are two time-related settings per data provider:
"Time Zone Delta" and "Timestamp shift".

**Time Zone Delta** is a difference between local and system timestamps. It only affects the chart grid, but not the data.

**Timestamp shift** actually introduces the shift of timestamps compared to what is coming from the data source.
